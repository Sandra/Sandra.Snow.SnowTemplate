title: ASP.NET MVC 4 has, REAL EMPTY PROJECT!
category: Rant

I installed Visual Studio 2012 over the weekend, and was BLOWN AWAY when I created a brand new MVC 4 project to find:

![](/images/asp-real-empty-1.png)

See that 'Empty' project... It now creates:

![](/images/asp-real-empty-2.png)

Look at that, nice and clean. It still forces the whole WebApi thing on you, but atleast they cut out 90% of the rubbish that was in it previously.

I'm REALLY happy with the changes after I previously ranted earlier this year:

[MVC 4 Project Templates are stupid](/2012/02/mvc-4-project-templates-are-stupid/)

Thank you Microsoft!
