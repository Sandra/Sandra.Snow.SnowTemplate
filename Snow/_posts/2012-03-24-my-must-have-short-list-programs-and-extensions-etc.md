title: My must have (short) list programs/extensions etc
---

We have all seen these lists before, but I've decided I'll make a list of all the software I use or think are a must have, blog it, then this time next year I can do the list again and see how much it's changed.

### Visual Studio 2010 ###
What can I say, I'm a .NET Developer :)

### ReSharper ###
<http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/>

This should just ship with Visual Studio, without ReSharper I feel so unproductive in VS.

### MindScape Web Workbench ###
<http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench>

This VS extension just gets better and better, I primarily got it to write LESS and CoffeeScript, but recently they added support for minifying and combining JavaScript and CSS files. Really cool stuff and I highly recommend it.

### BugAid ###
<http://www.bugaidsoftware.com/>

<!--excerpt-->

This is a relatively new extension, it extends the debugging tools in Visual Studio and gives more information where it can. It was a little annoying at first, but they are listening to the community and fixing issues, adding features, it's coming along nicely and I recommend it!

### MightyMoose / NCrunch ###
<http://www.continuoustests.com/> / <http://www.ncrunch.net/>

These two tools are the same taken from two different approaches with two different goals. As a result I'm really torn between them. I love features from both, and I've been using MightyMoose at work and NCrunch at home. NCrunch has code-coverage which Greg Young [disagrees](http://goodenoughsoftware.net/2012/03/21/code-coverage/) with. I guess that's what's stopping me from adopting [LOLCats](http://goodenoughsoftware.net/2012/03/01/mighty-moose-lolcats/) and [Gary](http://goodenoughsoftware.net/2012/03/06/gary/), and other cool features in MM.

### PostgreSQL ###
<http://www.postgresql.org/>

One thing I don't like about SQL Server, is having to install it and have it run all the time... But I've always loved PostgreSQL as well, and hated MySQL. (*checkout Tekpubs "The Perils of MySQL" for a glimpse of why I don't like it*). Why I think this is a must have is I recently found out [you don't actually need to install it to run](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/172-Starting-PostgreSQL-in-windows-without-install.html). This makes it great for a dev environment where you want to run up an instance on demand when you need it.

### RavenDB ###
<http://ravendb.net/>

If you're a .NET developer and not already looking at, or using RavenDB... I don't know you... RavenDB makes working with a document database, fun, and easy to learn, and constantly blows my mind.

### ILSpy ###
<http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ilspy.ashx>

Of all the reflection tools available I prefer ILSpy. No real reason it just works and is fast.

### Sublime Text ###
<http://www.sublimetext.com/>

I used to be a massive fan of [EditPlus](http://editplus.com/), infact I've used it for over 10 years... But recently found Sublime text due to [Tuts+ 30 Days to learn jQuery](http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/), and haven't gone back to EditPlus. It has awesome plugin features.

### NHProf ###
<http://nhprof.com/>

Since I tend to use NHibernate quite a bit, well not so much now that RavenDB is about, but when using NHibernate I use NHProf to view the generated queries. One really, really, really handy tool.

There's a lot of other little tools I use, like Fiddler, [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc), etc. But I just wanted to list the things I use all the time.
